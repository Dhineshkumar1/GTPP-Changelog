2. UI Changes:
	  - Separate MEC Courses from default Topics.        

#### Update Prepackaged courses and GTPP topics

UI Updates:
1. Update MEC topics in Prepackaged dropdown.
2. Fetching MEC topics from API should only update the Prepackaged topics based on Name match. If matched, then update the ID column. No Insertion of MEC topics into Prepackaged table.
3. Duration flow is as it is. 
4. Generate Promocode for all events irrespective of any conditions.

API Updates:
1. Show Duration in API Response as single value. [Not for each topic] Duration should be the midrange value. [If duration is 1-2 hours, then show it as 1.5 hrs]
2. Send each MEC courses as separate object  and general or prepackaged topics as single object

### Aug 14, 2019
Updated the API changes

### Jul 27, 2019
1. Create Promocode on selected training topics during Create/Edit event
2. Redeem API to send Training topics for the promocode
3. Client view to access thos APIs

### Jul 22, 2019

1. On Event Create - If this training topic is available in MEC system, then we need to genrate Promocode.
        (From MEC system, get all promocodes and verify that the selected training topics is available - through api)
        
2. Generate 2 APIs, one for sending the MEC training topics selected for that promocode (and reduce the count to 1 from total attendees)
        second api for adding the attendees count for that promocode.
1. Learning Topics API with client view to access the Api
2. Keep link at Admin View page to refresh the list.

While calling the API, insert the topics into DB and show the inserted topics to the user

Avoid keeping button in Admin View. Instead, populate the Topics from API on clicking Create event


### Jul 12, 2019, Jul 27, 2019

1. Update the latest Topics and Pre-Packaged courses in DB. The GTPP Topics and the Pre-packaged courses list remains the same all the time. If any change is needed it will be handled manually at the backend.

2. Using the MEC API response, check whether any of the MEC courses exist in the pre-packaged courses list by matching the course name. If found, need to save all the MEC details (MEC ID, type, name, description) so we can return this information when redeem code API gets called. [DOn't insert new topics from API]
Note: These 3 pre-packaged courses are MEC courses so we will do the mapping manually if needed (Microsoft Innovative Educator (MIE) Trainer Academy, MIE OneNote Teacher Academy, MIE Office 365 Teacher Academy)

3. Promo code should be generated for all the Events irrespective of the delivery type.

4. Promo Codes should start with the letter of first name and last time (ie Ginelle Cousins = GC) and end with fiscal year (ie FY20 = 20).  In between 5 alpha and numeric characters, avoiding using a zero and O unless it’s in trainer name.  Example for Ginelle Cousins = GC9YTL20

5. Instead of the range, need to calculate the middle of the event duration and include that in the redeem API response. [Refer the email with Subject; Updated API format]
